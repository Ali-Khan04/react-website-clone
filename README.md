# React Website Replica

This project is a **React** website replica, designed to mimic the appearance and animations of a popular website. It includes various smooth hover effects, animations, and interactive elements using CSS and React's custom components.

## Features

- **Header Logo Hover Animation**: In the header, the "React" text fades out on hover, and the React logo smoothly appears in its place.
- **Main Logo Spinning Animation**: The main React logo in the first section spins continuously. On hover, the spin speed increases, and it pauses on click.
- **Dual Section Layout**: The website is split into two sections:
  - **Section 1**: Contains a rotating React logo, buttons, and an image.
  - **Section 2**: Displays a secondary React logo that scales on hover and increases in size when clicked.
- **Interactive Buttons**: The buttons have smooth hover and active transitions, changing color and adding a small press effect when clicked.


-  ## In Future
-  **More sections** shall be added with more interactive features using Express Framework.
-  **React props** animations will be made more customizable using props.
